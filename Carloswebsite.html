            While taking a Engineering Research and Design class, I found a passion in designing and creating products. This led me into the world of Engineering, that I still continue to explore in many ways, such a engineering competitions, clubs, and societies. Within these activities I have discovered my career plan, that is becoming a Design Engineer. I plan on getting my Design Engineering Masters Degree at UC Berkeley and then working my way into an Engineering company called the International Design and Consulting Firm or IDEO for short. While working in this company my goal is to eventually earn a position as Engineering project manager and continue to advance in the company.
